Kumar Hamy Sharma is my name. I am from Baran Rajasthan and currently residing in Chandigarh, where I am pursuing an MCA degree from Chandigarh University. I am confident and professional in my approach to my goals and profession, and I would like to work under pressure because it strengthens my resolve to perform well and quickly. I am quick to observe my surroundings and adjust my behaviour accordingly. I am multitasking and will not lose focus if someone assigns me two tasks concurrently. I completed my Digital Marketing course from MyCaptain (Online Learning Platform) and earned a certification in it, as well as IBM's What is Data Science course from Courseera and Infosys Springboard's Angular course.
